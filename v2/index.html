        The second version that improved the rotation logic. <br>
        Now, the square pivots around the selected corner, <br>
        making it more intuitive and fun to play with. <br>
        But, it still wasn't able to move the square, <br>
        The rotation idea is sound! Yesterday's error gave me the ghost square idea!<br>
        This was a step forward, but still not the complete game.
