        The third version that introduced the ghost square preview. <br>
        Now, you can see where the square will move before you make the move. <br>
        This makes it a bit easier to plan your moves and avoid mistakes. <br>
        The rotation logic is fixed, and the ghost square shows the future position of the square. <br>
        The basic game mechanics are in place, but there's still room for layout and scoring <br>
        as well as visual and UX improvements. <br>
